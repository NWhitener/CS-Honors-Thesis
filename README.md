## Code Description
This project uses the Flower framework for federated learning. Initial steps used the quickstart guide for scikit-learn (https://flower.dev/docs/quickstart-scikitlearn.html). Source code for the utils.py, server.py and client.py was taken from the provided documentation. Changes were made to the server, client, and utils script to include custom data loading, model events (training iterations, etc.), and an additional round of Logistic regression for final validation.
